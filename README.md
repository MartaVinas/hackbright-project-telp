hackbright project

This is a web application that allows the user to select restaurants from San Francisco and shows the average tip that is given for lunch and dinner. 
The user can also see what is the average tip by zipcode instead of restaurant.

Users are asked to input the price and the percentage tip of their meal and the application returns how much the tip is and its total cost.
